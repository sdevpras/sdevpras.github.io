  <p>So, this is evidently my first post here and never did I imagine I’d be this glum writing it. Partly because Independence Day falls on a Saturday and I&rsquo;m missing a holiday. I truly wish that was the mere reason though. If you haven’t heard the news already, Bayern Munich demolished a dispirited Barcelona side 8-2. Yes, Barcelona were on the receiving end of those eight goals. And yes, it all unfolded in a single UCL match. My expectations coming in to this match were low, but <em>holy shit</em>. The only other match with that score line that comes to memory is Arsenal’s humbling at Old Trafford in the Premier League nine years ago. Nine years indeed seems like a long time ago now, for the nostalgia associated with that time is strong. Back in 2011, Barcelona were crowned La Liga champions and bagged the UCL in emphatic fashion. By ruthlessly dominating matches and playing the kind of football that even the biggest of rivals envy, that team could arguably be one of the greatest sides ever to grace football. Sigh, how the mighty has fallen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bayern-bloodbath/lost.jpg" alt="Lost"></p>
<p>As shocking as this result may seem to non-Barca fans, most of our supporters saw this coming. This collapse didn’t happen overnight. It was a product of years of atrocious signings, clueless management, lack of motivation and sheer complacency of the board. We’ve spent over a billion euros in the last six years for a club that used to pride on developing youth talent. And the players that we bought have either been sold for less or have not been played in their preferred position. It seems that whenever a new player is brought in, they lose their mental strength. Perhaps, they are subconsciously influenced by the languishing mentality that’s permeating deep within our club. From bottling the matches at Anfield and Roma to this humiliation, we might need a psychologist rather than a manager. The entire club needs an overhaul. While our arch rivals Real Madrid went on to win the UCL thrice, here we are, getting knocked out embarrassingly thrice in a row. This club isn’t helping my mental health. Not to mention, I’ll have to grapple with the depressing fact that Messi might retire in a few years. It pains to see him waste his last years in a rotting club like ours. Hope he finds the joy in football again, here or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? I truly do not know. The elections are imminent and (hopefully) Bartomeu steps down. But don’t underestimate the survival power of rats. With most players in their twilight years and the upcoming talents too young to have reached their peaks and hardly any players in their prime years to steer the ship, I don’t see us winning anything for the next few years. The future does look bleak.</p>
<p>FC Barcelona had just set sail in 2008 with great anticipation, synonymous to the Titanic leaving Southampton harbour. And while it did feel amazing riding the high waves, we should have seen the iceberg coming. Instead, we were lying to ourselves by hiding behind the veil of overconfidence and complacency. After all, wasn’t our ship invincible? Unsinkable? We collided with the iceberg and started to sink many years ago. But only now did it go underwater for the people to start to take notice. Too little, too late. Henceforth, this once legendary ship will erode away lying motionless at the bottom of the ocean. Not disappearing entirely, but laying there quiescently till one day, a diver discovers its lost glory and embarks on the Herculean task to bring it back to the surface.</p>
